## Description 
EmptyUp is an application designed to showcase vacant buildings within a city. It relies on a community of users who contribute by uploading information about empty buildings to the platform.  

The platform features a map that displays buildings uploaded by users, whether they have an account or not.   
An authentication system provides users with access to a profile, allowing them to:
- Upload building information.
- Comment on buildings to update details.
- Like buildings and create a personal list of liked/registered buildings.
- Post or view ads related to buildings.
- Connect with other users who have commented on a building or posted an ad. 

A search system enables users to filter buildings based on:
- The city of the building.
- The type of the building.
- The date of upload.
- The most commented.
- The most liked.
